# What is a programming language - lesson plan ---- teacher



Say, "Computers need very clear instructions for them to follow! Just like this: If you wanted your friend to draw a rainbow, but they did not know how to draw one, you can't just say, "Draw a rainbow!" Instead, you would have to give them instructions. Then, you can define a function (like telling someone, "That's how you draw a rainbow!" at the end) called `Draw a rainbow` so that they know how next time when you say, "Draw a rainbow!". In puesdocode(fake code) it would look like this:
```
func. draw a rainbow
||| Draw a big red curved line
||| Draw a slightly smaller one that is orange
||| Keep repeating that in these colors: ["yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]
>end function

comment(this will be ignored): Now you can say, "draw a rainbow"
Draw a rainbow!
```

By the way, computers can't understand English! They need instructions written in a **programming language** for them to follow.
